For those looking for a practical guide on which fonts they should use for a written work, refer to the section *Practical Applications*.

# Glossary

Below is a brief overview of terms and definitions commonly used in this document:

A **typeface** (or a **font family**) is a set of designs defining the shape of glyphs like letters, numbers, or other symbols ([“Typography Terms”](#typography-terms)). Examples include Times New Roman, Helvetica, Arial, etc.

A **font** is a specific combination of a typeface with other factors, like size, weight, 	spacing, etc. that more fully defines how glyphs appear in a work ([Gibbens and Fessenden](#gibbens-fessenden)). For example, while Arial is a typeface, *10-point italicized Arial* is a font.

A **serif** is a feature of a typeface, where a small line or hook appears at the end of a stroke ([“Typography Terms”](#typography-terms)). Examples of serif typefaces include Times New Roman and Garamond. Examples of **sans serif** typefaces (typefaces that don’t use serifs) include Helvetica and Arial.

**Point size** or **body size** is the height of the virtual “box” a character exists in. Fonts are designed so that characters fit within the box height, but don’t completely fill the box ([“Typography Terms”](#typography-terms)).

**X-height** is the height of a standard lowercase letter in a typeface, as measured by the height of the letter **x** ([Gibbens and Fessenden](#gibbens-fessenden)).

**Weight** is the thickness of the lines in character ([Gibbens and Fessenden](#gibbens-fessenden)). A single typeface can be designed with different weights in mind to form multiple fonts.

**Linespacing** or **leading** is vertical space between lines of text, as measured from the baseline of one line to that of the next ([“Typography Terms”](#typography-terms)).

**Letter spacing** is horizontal space in text, between different characters and words ([Gibbens and Fessenden](#gibbens-fessenden)).

# Research Summary

This section analyzes and summarizes a number of studies on this topic. In total, 11 studies have been examined to inform the contents below.

## Measuring Readability

“Readability” and “legibility” can refer to many different things about a text, and different variables can be used within a study to measure readability/legibility. 

### Reading Time and Speed

Given a text, reading time is the amount of time it takes for a person to read that text. When comparing texts of different lengths, reading speed is the amount of words or syllables a person can read in a unit of time.

Reading time and speed are the most common measurements in readability studies, being used as dependent variables in every study examined. 

### Reading Accuracy and Comprehension

Given a text to be read aloud, accuracy can be measured as the words read incorrectly, or as some derivative calculation. [Galliussi et al.](#galliussi), for example, uses the “the logarithm of the number of words read correctly divided by the number of errors” [(145)](#galliussi). [Bernard et al.](#bernard-text-size) divide their accuracy ratio by the reading speed [(“Text Size and Format” 828)](#bernard-text-size). [Daxer et al.](#daxer) use raw reading errors instead of accuracy [(1183)](#daxer), since their study’s passages are designed to be similar and comparable. [Holly and Powell](#joseph-powell) use a standardized test called TOWRE-2 to measure accuracy, wherein children try to read as many words and non-words from a list within 45 seconds [(453)](#joseph-powell).

Comprehension is another related measurement, which is determined by how well participants answer a questionnaire after reading the passage. For instance, [Huang](#huang) includes multiple-choice questions after every passage [(68)](#huang). [Wallace et al.](#wallace) also do this, supplementing it with a questionnaire on topic familiarity and interest to isolate the effects from font alone [(19)](#wallace).

Many studies use comprehension and accuracy scores as a filter to ensure participants don’t skim through text, rather than as a dependent variable. [Tešinović](#tesinovic), for example, does not include subjects who got 30% error or more in identifying words on screen [(184)](#tesinovic). [Joseph and Powell](#joseph-powell) use a comprehension question after texts to “maintain focus and check children were on task” [(455)](#joseph-powell). [Wallace et al.](#wallace), in addition to using it as a measurement, also exclude participants with low comprehension scores [(20)](#wallace).

### Preference and Perceived Readability

Some studies measure how much a reader subjectively prefers that font/typeface. Both [Huang](#huang) and [Wallace et al.](#wallace) allowed participants to toggle between two different fonts and select which one they preferred better ([68](#huang); [10](#wallace)). 

Additionally, some studies measured *perceived* or *subjective* readability; that is, how easy or hard participants *state* they found a font to read in was, as opposed to an external, objective measurement. [Boyarski et al.](#boyarski), for instance, asked participants to rate fonts compared with each other on how easy it is to read, how sharp the characters are, and how legible they are [(88)](#boyarski). [Bernard et al.](#bernard-popular-online) recorded both the perceived legibility and the attractiveness of (preference for) fonts [(“Popular Online Fonts” 3-4)](#bernard-popular-online).

### Other Measurements

Some studies use types of measurements not covered above. [Beier and Oderkerk](#beier-oderkerk), for example, use the Radner reading chart and the logRAD score to measure reading acuity and critical print size [(56)](#beier-oderkerk). 

## Measurements Not Affected

Of the measurements described above, reading accuracy and comprehension has often been found to be unaffected by any variation in fonts or other factors. [Huang](#huang) found that font variables did not affect participants’ performance on its comprehension tests, stating that “reading comprehension scores are not a useful indicator to find out the optimal typefaces” [(71)](#huang). Likewise, [Wallace et al.](#wallace) found that there was “minimum variation in \[reading comprehension\] scores,” with topic interest and familiarity being significantly more affecting [(24)](#wallace). Given this, the choice to use accuracy and comprehension primarily as a filter tool, as in [Daxer et al.](#daxer) or [Tešinović et al.](#tesinovic), makes sense, since using it as a dependent variable likely wouldn’t have shown a correlation.

## Effect from Font Sizes

A common finding across studies examined here is that the size of a font is one of the bigger factors when it comes to legibility. Specifically, a larger font size can lead to better readability.

[Bernard et al.](#bernard-text-size), for instance, found that participants subjectively perceived 12-point fonts to be more legible, sharper, and easier to read compared to 10-point fonts [(“Text Size and Format” 831-32)](#bernard-text-size). [Huang](#huang) states that studies which had previously found a significant effect from typefaces had confounded it with an effect from font size, as their own study, which had adjustable viewing distances, did not show any effect [(71)](#huang). 

## Normalizing Font Size

All typefaces are designed within a virtual “box,” which is what a computer (or metal cast) scales characters by. When the size of a font is selected to be “10 point” or “12 point,” this refers to the height of the box. However, within the box, typefaces can design their characters to have different heights. So a text in Times New Roman and a text in Arial can be set at the same point size, but the “actual” size of the characters will be different. 

Because size affects a text’s legibility, studies wanting to isolate the effects of typefaces alone must adjust the sizes of fonts used to match each other. The different approaches for font normalization are shown below.

### X-Height

Matching two fonts by their x-height is the most common form of normalization, as used in the studies by [Daxer et al.](#daxer), [Wallace et al.](#wallace), [Beier and Oderkerk](#beier-oderkerk), etc. As the size of the “main body” of lowercase letters, x-height has been shown to affect legibility, and some fonts such as Georgia have been designed with larger x-heights in mind [(Boyarski et al. 87)](#boyarski).

### Character Height

Some studies normalize size by another height value. For example, [Wallace et al.](#wallace) include an approach where, from each font, the highest and lowest points in a string of character is taken, an “overall” height is created from the lowest subtracted from the highest point, and fonts are scaled based on that [(14)](#wallace).

### Character Width

Also used in [Wallace et al.](#wallace) is an adjustment based on character width. A string of reference characters is used to measure the overall width of a typeface, which is then scaled up or down [(14)](#wallace).

### Choosing Normalization Methods

As mentioned above, x-height is the most commonly used method of normalization. [Wallace et al.](#wallace) stated the most effective method of normalization differs depending on the font being scaled, and used a separate study to determine which fonts should use which method [(15-17)](#wallace).

Another option used would be to not scale fonts at all, instead keeping all typefaces at the same point size. This approach is used primarily in older studies such as [Boyarski et al.](#boyarski), which acknowledges the effect of x-height but does not normalize sizes [(87)](#boyarski), concluding that their results shouldn’t be generalized out of this [(93)](#boyarski).

## Effect from Typeface

The studies examined here, when analyzed as a whole, do not present a clear-cut conclusion on whether typefaces affect readability or not.

### Reading Speed

[Daxer et al.](#daxer), for example, compared Times New Roman and Helvetica after having adjusted their x-heights, and found that they were comparable [(1180)](#daxer). A similar conclusion was reached by [Huang](#huang), wherein the effect of font size was reduced due to adjustable viewing distances, and the three Chinese typefaces did not show significant effect [(71)](#huang). 

[Bernard et al.](#bernard-text-size), in “Text Size and Format”, also did not observe differences in reading speed between Times and Arial, even as they did not adjust for x-height. They did find an outlier, wherein the specific combination of 10-point Arial with anti-aliasing performed worse than others [(830)](#bernard-text-size).

[Tešinović et al.](#tesinovic), who examined both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts of Serbian, found that Arial resulted in faster word identification speeds than Times, specifically when the words were in lowercase . However, the size of this effect was described as “trivial” [(190)](#tesinovic). They ultimately chalked the difference up to Arial’s larger x-height, which they did not adjust for. Conversely, they found that Times was better for Cyrillic words in uppercase; once again, the effect size was “trivial.” They attributed this effect to Times New Roman’s serifs, which made individual letters more distinctive and recognizable, especially when parts of the letters were obscured. 

[Beier and Oderkerk](#beier-oderkerk) found that, specifically for older participants, that is, those over 50 years old, Gill Sans contributed to higher reading speed. Conversely, KBH had both a smaller critical print size and better reading acuity, allowing readers to read texts accurately and quickly at smaller print sizes [(62)](#beier-oderkerk). They attribute Gill Sans’ higher reading speed to its lighter stroke weight and the uneven spacing between its letters. Meanwhile, they attribute KBH’s better reading acuity and CPS to its greater inter-letter spacing overall [(60-61)](#beier-oderkerk).

[Bernard et al.](#bernard-popular-online), in an earlier study (“Popular Online Fonts”), states that reading in either Times or Arial results in faster speeds than reading in Georgia or Courier. This study does not adjust for x-height, so one could attribute this speed difference to font size at first. However, Georgia is known to have a greater x-height than Times [(Boyarski et al. 87)](#boyarski), going against the convention of larger x-heights leading to better readability, suggesting the typeface itself may be the cause. 

[Wallace et al.](#wallace) examined 16 different fonts, with sizes adjusted using a combination of methods (see [Choosing Normalization Methods](#choosing-normalization-methods) above). They found that, for participants above 35, typeface was significant in affecting reading speeds, with EB Garamond being the fastest and Open Sans being the slowest. This effect disappeared in the general population i.e. when including those under 35 [(23-24)](#wallace). Most significantly, typeface mattered in a major way on an individual basis, with participants reading 35% faster in their fastest typeface compared to their slowest [(26)](#wallace). This effect, however, varies in directionality across individuals, so what is the fastest typeface for one may be the slowest in the next, and thus this effect shrinks or disappears when generalized across a whole group [(27)](#wallace).

### Reading Accuracy

As mentioned in the section [Measurements Not Affected](#measurements-not-affected), reading accuracy is very often not affected significantly by any typographic variables, and is often just used as a filtering requirement instead. Regardless, some interesting results regarding accuracy can still be found.

[Bernard et al.](#bernard-popular-online) in “Popular Online Fonts” measured “reading efficiency,” which is expressed as reading time divided by accuracy. Whereas reading speed on its own was found to be significantly affected by font size and type, no such effects were found for reading efficiency. This led to the authors suggesting that “fonts that were read faster were generally read less accurately” [(2)](#bernard-popular-online).  

## Dyslexia and Dyslexic-Friendly Fonts

Dyslexia is a learning disorder wherein “an individual has significant difficulty with speed and accuracy of word decoding” [(Siegel 581)](#siegel). Some have investigated whether font selection can help dyslexic readers decode words faster and easier, some designing specialized typefaces with features believed to be easier for dyslexic readers to read.

[Holly and Powell](#joseph-powell) compared one such specialized typeface, Dyslexie, with Calibri, in school children. Dyslexie features increased spacing between letters and letterform designs that are more distinct from each other, which is claimed to help dyslexic readers identify letters more easily [(450)](#joseph-powell).

They compare the two fonts on how dyslexic and non-dyslexic children perform with them on 3 different tasks. They found that for the application of rapid letter naming, Dyslexie helped both dyslexic and non-dyslexic children improve speeds [(461)](#joseph-powell). However, for reading words and passages, no effect for using Dyslexie was found [(462)](#joseph-powell). They thus recommended that Dyslexie could be used to aid in the earliest stages of learning to read, where children have to match letters to sound, but have limited utility afterwards [(463)](#joseph-powell). They did also note that the dyslexic children were of a much higher age than the non-dyslexic group, and came from a specialized dyslexia-training school, so their results may be less generalizable to the overall dyslexic population [(463)](#joseph-powell).

[Galliussi et al.](#galliussi) designed their own dyslexia-friendly typeface, with similarities to the EasyReading typeface, and compared it with Verdana Pro Condensed, testing on both dyslexic and non-dyslexic children [(144)](#galliussi). They further added inter-letter and inter-word spacing as extra independent variables [(144)](#galliussi). They found that typeface had no effect on reading speed nor accuracy for either group; spacing also had no effect, with the specific combination of increased inter-letter and normal inter-word spacing being detrimental to speed. 

## Underexplored Areas

Given the above existing research, there are some areas which I suggest would be worth exploring for anyone interested in researching this topic in the future.

In the process of making this document, no studies were found that use neuro-imaging while participants read in different fonts. Future research could further implement this form of knowledge, connecting the topic with that of neuroscience, visual processing, and language processing in the brain.
